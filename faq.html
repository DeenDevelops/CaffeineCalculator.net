            <h2><strong>FAQ</strong></h2>
            <p><strong>Q: What metrics are the calculator's computations based on?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A: </strong> The recommended caffeine metrics provided by the Caffeine Calculator are derived from FDA guidelines applicable to a "healthy adult."
                These metrics are further substantiated by the scholarly work found in the article:
                <a href="https://www.academia.edu/26921513/Effects_of_caffeine_on_human_health" target="_blank">
                    Effects of caffeine on human health</a>. In the abstract, P Nawrot et. all states, "Based on the data reviewed,
                    it is concluded that for the healthy adult population, moderate daily caffeine intake at a dose level up to 400 mg day(-1)
                    (equivalent to 6 mg kg(-1) body weight day(-1) in a 65-kg person) is not associated with adverse effects such as general toxicity,
                    cardiovascular effects, effects on bone status and calcium balance (with consumption of adequate calcium), changes in adult behaviour,
                    increased incidence of cancer and effects on male fertility."
            </p>
            <p>The recommended timing for caffeine consumption is informed by Standford's Neuroscientist Andrew Huberman's guideline: "Delay your caffeine intake to 90 to
                120 minutes after waking up." For more information, please see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iw97uvIge7c&ab_channel=AndrewHuberman"
